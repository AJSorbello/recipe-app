## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the `recipe-app` repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AJSorbello/recipe-app.git
   cd recipe-app
Setting Up the Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
On Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Installing Dependencies
If you have a requirements.txt file, install the dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
If the file is not available, you can manually install the necessary packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install django
pip install djangorestframework  # If using Django REST Framework
pip install Pillow  # For image handling
Applying Migrations
Before running the application, apply the necessary database migrations:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
Creating a Superuser
To access the Django admin panel, you'll need to create a superuser account:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py createsuperuser
Follow the prompts to create the admin account.

Running the Development Server
Start the Django development server:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
By default, the server will run at http://127.0.0.1:8000/. Open this URL in your web browser to access the application.

Collecting Static Files
If your project uses static files, collect them with:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py collectstatic
This command will gather all static files into a single directory defined in your settings.py.

Troubleshooting
Missing Migrations: If you encounter issues with missing migrations, run:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
Static Files Not Loading: Ensure that STATIC_URL and STATICFILES_DIRS are correctly configured in settings.py.

Environment Issues: If you encounter issues related to dependencies or environment, make sure you are in the correct virtual environment (venv) and that all dependencies are installed.
